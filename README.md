# jqSlide
A jQuery plugin for converting an img tag into a functional slide puzzle

## Usage
The compiled jqSlide.js creates a jQuery function - jqSlide - which can be called on an img tag in order to create a puzzle.
    $( "#myImgTag" ).jqSlide();
    
## Building
jqSlide can be compiled by executing the RequireJS optimizer, using build.js as a configuration file.  This creates ./dist/jqSlide.js.
    r.js -o build.js

## JSDoc
JSDoc can be generated by executing JSDoc with one of two included profiles - jsdoc.conf.dev.json (includes private) or jsdoc.conf.pub.json (hides private, used for release documentation).  Documentation is created in the ./doc/ directory.
    jsdoc -c json.conf.dev.json
